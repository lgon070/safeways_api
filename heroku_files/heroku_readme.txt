SafeWays Safepath API runs on Google App Engine, to run this Flask app on Heroku you will need to modify the root folder.

Replace app.yaml with the Procfile
Replace main.py with app.py

++ The file 'restful-version-app.py' is not needed for either heroku or google app engine and simply exists for any other hosting service that resquires restful flask. ++
